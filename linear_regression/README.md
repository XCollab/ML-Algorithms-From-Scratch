# Linear Regression Implementations

This folder contains two implementations of Linear Regression:

1. `linear_regression_scratch.py` - Implementation of Linear Regression from scratch using numpy
2. `linear_regression_sklearn.py` - Implementation using scikit-learn's built-in LinearRegression

## Theory
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

## Requirements
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
