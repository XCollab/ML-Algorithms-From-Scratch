# ML-Algorithms-From-Scratch

A comprehensive collection of machine learning algorithms implemented both from scratch and using popular libraries. Each implementation includes detailed explanations, mathematical concepts, and practical examples.

## 🎯 Project Goal
This repository aims to provide clear, well-documented implementations of machine learning algorithms to help understand their inner workings. Each algorithm is implemented twice:
1. From scratch using NumPy (to understand the core concepts)
2. Using popular libraries like scikit-learn (for practical applications)


## 🗂️ Algorithms Included
- Linear Regression
  - Methods:
    - Gradient Descent
    - Normal Equation
  - Simple Linear Regression
  - Multiple Linear Regression
